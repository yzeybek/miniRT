# miniRT

## Description

### Project Goal 🎯

The goal of this project is building a minimal version of ray tracing engine. This engine, allows to rendering realistic computer-generated images from a simply formatted file. Also dealing with computer graphics world, develops learner in mathematical face of coding. Along with the already known concepts like; parsing, high scale project developing and necessary limitation chooses, project introduce; ray tracing pipeline, illumination types and geometry based rendering.
