Mandatory:
* Raytracing / Rasterizing
* Objects: Plane, Sphere, Cylinder
/*If applicable, all possible intersections and the insides of the objects must be handled correctly.*/
* Must handle the resize for objects; diameter for sphere, width-height for cylinder
* Translation and rotation transformation applied to objects, lights and cameras
* Lights; spot brightness, hard shadows, ambient lightning, diffuse lightning
* Parse; ambient lightning (A), camera (C), Light (L), sphere (sp), plane (pl), cylinder (cl)

Bonus list:
* Add specular reflection to achieve a full Phong reflection model.
* Color disruption: checkerboard pattern.
* Colored and multi-spot lights.
* One other second-degree object: cone, hyperboloid, paraboloid..
* Handle bump map textures.
